# Rocket
Another asteroids clone in python... This repository is a work in progress. So far, I have the asteroid physics, rocket physics, missile physics, and collision physics in place. I still need to handle starting/ending games as well as score keeping. 

# To Run (Linux)

$ git clone https://github.com/ctgallagher4/Rocket

$ cd Rocket

$ python3 rocket.py
