# Rocket
Another asteroids clone in python from scratch... This repository is a work in progress. So far, I have the asteroid generation and rocket physics in place. I still need to handle collisions.

# To Run (Linux)

$ git clone https://github.com/ctgallagher4/Rocket

$ cd Rocket

$ python3 rocket.py
